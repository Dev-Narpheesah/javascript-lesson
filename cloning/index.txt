Definition and Usage
The clone keyword is used to create a copy of an object.

If any of the properties was a reference to another variable or object, then only the reference is copied. Objects are always passed by reference, so if the original object has another object in its properties, the copy will point to the same object. This behavior can be changed by creating a __clone() method in the class.

// to create a new object that copies the top level
 structure of the original object but not in its nested object of array,
 in other word if the original object or array contains nested object 
 or array, the shallow cloe will create new reference to those 
 nested object rather than creating new copies. when u have nested object inside an object
 the reference here will tamper the child object instead of the Main object
