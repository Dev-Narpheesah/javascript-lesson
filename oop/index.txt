Java - What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.


// The NEW keyword --> creates a new empty object

// THIS keyword --> is used to reference the object that is executing the current function.         In otherwords every function has a reference to its current executon context

// Class keyword --> is a schema that can save many many many values   just as u can define function declaration & expression.
// it can be defined as
// 1. Class derclaration
