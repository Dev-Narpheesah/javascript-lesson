TRICKY CONCEPT

Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

JavaScript variables have 2 types of scope:

Local scope
Global scope

Local variables have Function Scope:

They can only be accessed from within the function.

Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.



Global Scope
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

They all have Global Scope:


                                      Advantages of Global Variables

                      u can access d global variables from all functions in a program.
                      it is used for storing constant ideally as it helps to keep consistency.
                      it is useful when multiple functions are accessing d same data

                                     Disadvantages of Global Variables
                       Too many variables declared as global, then they remain in memory till program execution is completed.This can cause out of memory issue.
                       it may give unpredictable result in multitasking enviroment.
                       if global variable are discountinued due to code refactoring, u will need to change all d modules where they are called.
